	NOTE TO CURIOUS CODE SNOOPERS;

	Welcome! I publish this code to GitHub for a reason, so those learning to code in HTML and CSS can easily reference it if they like a certain design or "way of doing something" I've included in this website. You are welcome to copy/paste any bit of code within this repository, free of charge or credit. Seriously, where would web developers be if they didn't copy/paste.

	I just ask one small thing. As someone going to college to be a teacher, I want those learning HTML and CSS to understand the content they're taking from a place like this. IF YOU BORROW/USE CODE, MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES AND HOW IT WORKS. DON'T JUST COPY AND PASTE IT. REALLY DIG IN AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE BORROWING/USING. 

	This only benefits your own personal HTML/CSS coding skills and will make you a better web developer.
	
	Cheers, happy coding,
	- Bluecolty

				<h3 class="text-center">Commissions Info and Terms of Service</h3>
				<hr>
				<p><em>A "commission" is defined as a digital good, created by Bluecolty, the specifications of which are agreed upon and approved by the client (you). Specifications, information, payment, and commission usage rules are explained in depth on this page. If you have any questions regarding information on this page, please ask before agreeing to the terms of service.</em></p>
				<br>

				<h5>Complete Commission Info:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><em><u>Blender Character Commissions: </u></em><br>Blender Character Commissions are offered in 3 different "levels" of digital goods. "Digital Goods" for Blender characters are defined as 1 .blend file containing your character- which you will receive in a .zip file upon completion of the commission. Characters are custom built to the clients liking, and the complexity/feature set is agreed upon before payment is requested. "Complexity/Feature Set" is defined by the complexity level outlined <a href="https://bluecolty.com/commissions/" target="_blank">[HERE].</a> Features and complexity level of the model and/or rig will be fully communicated by Bluecolty and agreed upon by the client.<br><br>Model and/or rigs will be in a neutral A pose with a neutral default expression. Commissions that require retopology will use a medium density quad topology. Rigs are generated using Rigify- which uses an industry standard, easy-to-use rig and animation sytem. Rigged models can be posed and animated using Blender. Blender models and/or rigs are not able to be exported for use outside of Blender. Blender Character Commissions use the EEVEE render engine and a "material-less" toon-shaded" shader.</li>
					<br>
					<li><em><u>Game/VTuber Character Commissions: </u></em><br>---</li>
				</ul>

				<hr>
				<br>
				<p><em>The following sections are the complete Terms of Service, broken down into easy to read and find sections.</em></p>
				<br>

				<h5>Payment/Cost/Refunds:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><em><u>Blender Character Commissions: </u></em><br>Before the commission process can begin, you must first submit a "quote request form" <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxYIQqRO8bIWeg2i-6-bX8PWwQFFBotewyVAQwvkMOAO1Hdg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">[HERE].</a> Submitting a form DOES NOT guarantee acceptance of the commission. I will contact you with a price estimate, and I will let you know if I can take your commission or not. You will receive a price estimate regardless of whether or not I can take your commission. If I can take your commission, we will discuss any further information/details, and a final price will be given. Once the final price is decided, my price WILL NOT change.<br><br>The price is based on a "base price", averaged from an X amount of hours to complete the type of commission. If the commission is estimated to take longer than the included base price allows, an hourly rate of +$15 USD/hour will be applied to calculate the final cost. I will provide you with an estimated hours for completion of the commission. Again, if I exceed this estimated time while working on your commission, you will NOT be billed extra! I simply provide you this information so you can have a transparent price breakdown.<br><br>Work on the commission will not begin until full payment is received. Payment will be handled through the agreed upon payment platform (currently PayPal or Ko-fi).<br><br>Once I receive your approval to start the commission, refunds <Strong>will not</Strong> be given.</li>
					<br>
					<li><em><u>Game/VTuber Character Commissions: </u></em><br>---</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Usage Rights:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><em><u>Blender Character Commissions: </u></em><br>Once you receive your character, it is yours to do whatever with. You may use it for animation, for a profile picture, banner, tracing for pose references, change/modify it, anything you can think of! ** It is yours to keep and modify as you please. You may take it to another artist to rig or turn into a game avatar, you can upgrade it yourself. I've made my money.<br><br>Please do not claim that you created the model. You (the client) owns or represents the character, the model and/or rig was created by Bluecolty. Credit is appreciated if someone asks who you commissioned to make it.<br><br>** I do not affiliate myself with any wrongdoings of the client once the model and/or rig is in the clients hands. Clients may use it for whatever purpose they please, however, please note, that IS NOT always a reflection of my own values.</li>
					<br>
					<li><em><u>Game/VTuber Character Commissions: </u></em><br>---</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Progress Updates:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><em><u>Blender Character Commissions: </u></em><br>Before commission work begins, I will give you a complete and finalized overview in message form of what your final commission will have. This overview will include the final price, estimated date of completion, and estimated hours it will take me.<br><br>Once you approve this, work will begin (payment must also be completed before work can begin).<br><br>During the time the commission is in progress, I will provide various progress updates and will be asking many questions. Even simple boring questions. If you have chosen the "Basic Character Model", you will receive one approval checkpoint before the commission is marked as done. If your commission is from the level "Rig Ready Character" or "Fully Rigged Character", you will receive additional approval checkpoints at major milestones during the model and/or rig creation process (base model creation, retopology, and rigging are the defined "major milestones").</li>
					<br>
					<li><em><u>Game/VTuber Character Commissions: </u></em><br>---</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Revisions:</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><em><u>Blender Character Commissions: </u></em><br>Because 3D is a very flexible but time consuming medium, revisions are given in a case by case basis. Small and medium sized revisions are allowed in "reasonably unlimited" quantities, but large revisions will be subject to an additional fee.<br><br>If you're unsure about whether or not I can do a revision, just ask! I don't bite, worst I'll say is "you'll need to pay more". I want you to be happy and love your model and/or rig!<br><br>"Small and medium" sized revisions are defined as "small tweaks, client preferences for shapes, and otherwise minor adjustments to your character". "Large" revisions are defined as requested revisions that are not visible on the turnaround, such as "an additional arm, a tail, a completely different outfit".<br><br>Please ensure your turnaround accurately reflects how you want your character to look. Work with either your turnaround artist or perfect your own turnaround to represent the look of your character. <em>In short,</em> as long as the revision is to something already on the turnaround, it is NOT subject to an additional fee.</li>
